# FreeCodeCamp Back End Development and APIs Certification Projects

I am happy to share my journey in completing all the **Back End Development and APIs Certification** certification projects from [freeCodeCamp]([https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/)). These projects use Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB to build APIs and backend applications that are efficient and meet modern development standards.

## Projects in This Repository

1. **Timestamp Microservice**: A simple API that converts dates in UNIX and UTC formats.
2. **Request Header Parser Microservice**: An API that retrieves the user's HTTP header information.
3. **URL Shortener Microservice**: An API that allows users to create a short version of a URL and access it easily.
4. **Exercise Tracker**: API for recording and managing users' exercise activities.
5. **Microservice Metadata File**: An API that allows users to upload files and get the metadata of those files.

## Features

- **Node.js & Express.js**: All projects are built using this technology for efficient backend development.
- **MongoDB & Mongoose**: Some projects use MongoDB databases to store and manage data.
- **RESTful API**: An API designed with standard HTTP methods for communication between the client and the server.
- **Middleware & Routing**: Uses Express middleware to handle efficient requests and routing.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures that the input received by the API is secure and in accordance with the specified specifications.

## How to Clone a Repository

Follow these steps to clone and run the project locally:
